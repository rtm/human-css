Human CSS
======

Human CSS is a system of **micro-attributes** which allow HTML to be styled semantically and readably,
while greatly reducing the need for individual CSS rules.
The great majority of common styling needs can be met by composing these micro-attributes.

Human CSS is based on the micro-class philosophy,
in which elements are styled within HTML by specifying one or more micro-classes.
However, instead of classes, we use attributes,
for greater brevity and readability.
Hence the term "micro-attributes".

With human CSS, many pages may need no specific CSS rules whatsoever.

For instance, consider:

```html
<span large dark red bold text></span>
<div thin light green top border></div>
<div one third width></div>
```

Human CSS provides an easy interface to using flexbox,
removing the need for the baroque grid systems some frameworks and libraries try to provide.
For instance, the classic `float: right` is just

```html
<div flex justify>
  <div>I'm on the left</div>
  <div>I'm on the right</div>
</div>
```

### Getting started

Install the library.

    $ npm install @rtm/human-css

Import it into your project's CSS, for example:

    @import "human-css";
    --or--
    @import "~human-css";


Background and Motivation
-------------------------

Our current CSS systems are a steaming pile of crap.
We have thousands of lines of CSS.
Half of these lines of CSS are not even used,
because no one can remember what they do and are afraid to touch them.
Most of the rest is redundant, over-specified, verbose, and duplicative.

Because CSS systems are most often created by "UI designers", rather than engineers,
basic computing principles of orthogonality, factoring, and composition are ignored.

We have become addicted to CSS preprocessors which
merely provide some basic syntactic sugar, and, more perniciously,
promote bad design practices.
Huge sets of rules with complex selectors bog down the browser.

Each new page we write requires dozens or hundreds of new lines of CSS.
Any UI change requires parallel changes to both HTML and CSS.
We use CSS in a way which results in inconsistent UIs.
We rewrite CSS over and over, since often there is no way to re-use what we have done.
There is no reasonable way to understand the CSS, or convince ourselves that it is correct, or test it.

In a futile attempt to escape this maze, we bring in monstrously large, over-engineered
frameworks such as Bootstrap, which add a massive surface area of new classes to learn and deal with.
Just as jQuery attempts to solve JavaScript problems which no longer need solving,
Bootstrap attempts to solve styling problems which no longer need solving,
in particular its cumbersome and confusing grid system.
In addition to added complexity for the programmer, these massive frameworks slow down
build times, page loading times, and rendering times.
They also make undue use of obsolete CSS features such as floats,
while failing to support modern CSS features such as flexbox.

As we proliferate these obese classes, we soon run into namespacing problems.
Names conflict with each other, and we end up needing weird namespace solutions which call for
classes with names like `Book__chapter--title`.
Then we start relying on preprocessors to handle these over-named classes,
which "help" us by allowing us to write weird-looking, brittle rules such as

    .Book {
      &__chapter {
        &--title {
          text-align: center;
          }
        }
     }

Human CSS attributes are is designed to put an end to this madness.

### Caveat

Human CSS attributes use CSS custom properties, also known as CSS variables, in its implementation.
This excludes IE11 from consideration.
Note that development of custom properties is underway for Edge.

Design Principles, Concepts and Features
----------------------------------------

### Micro-attributes

Human CSS is a collection of micro-attributes: HTML attributes with very particular meaning.
These attributes are assigned to HTML elements,
which in this approach may have two or five or even ten attributes.
**We are moving the styling logic back into the HTML!**
The styling in the HTML becomes semnatic and readable.
Instead of having a class "book-list-entry" which contains 20 properties over in some distant CSS file,
we add three or four attributes to HTML which clearly express the styling of the entry.
In the best case, which is readily realizable in practice, no element-specific class is necessary at all.

### Combining micro-attributes

Human CSS uses a relatively limited number of general-purpose micro-attributes.
So `green` means green for text, or borders, or backgrounds.
But what if I want to specify both text color **and** border color on an element?
How do I know which color is which?
Other micro-class frameworks solve this by a proliferation of classes such as `green-border`, and `green-text`.
We take a different approach, which is to place the attributes on individual, nested HTML elements:

```
<div one em margin>
  <div thick dark blue border>
    <div x-light pink background>
<div five percent padding>
        <div large bold white text>
          Bob
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Although this does result in more deeply nested HTML,
it also has major advantages.
Each element has a single, well-defined purpose,
and as mentioned above we need only generic attributes such as `blue` which work everywhere.

### Caveat

This repo uses CSS custom properties, also known as CSS variables, in its implementation.
This excludes IE11 from consideration.

### Colors

Human CSS allows you to easily think of colors in terms of their hue, lightness, and saturation,
using micro-attributes for hues (`red`), as well as saturations such as ``bright` and ligthnesses such as `dark`.

The color system exposes a single custom property on designated elements named `--color` which you may use as you see fit.

```
<span dark red color>
```

Colors are specified using the flexible HSL model.
This allows you to easily think of colors in terms of their hue, lightness, and saturation.
The standard hues are red, orange, yellow, lime, green, aquamarine, cyan, azure, blue, purple, magenta, and pink.
The hues can then be adjusted with additional micro-classes for saturation,
including `pure`, `x-bright`, `bright`, `dull`, `x-dull`, and `gray`,
and with additional micro-attributes for lightness,
including `white`, `x-light`, `light`, `dark`, `x-dark`, and `black`.

In addition, any HTML color, such as `steelblue`, can be used as an attribute to specify the desired color.
To distinguish HTML colors from hues of the same name, add the attribute `html`, as in `html red`.

#### Global HSL values

The actual application of a color to a specific element is triggered by the presence of the `color` attribute.
Without that, you are setting the hue, saturation, lightness, or alpha value for child elements.
For example, the following will yield a red bordered div, with lighter red text:

```
<div hue red>
  <div thick border color>
    <div lighter text color>
```

The global HSL values may be modified for a particular element by the attributes
`purer` or `brighter`, `duller` or `grayer`, `whiter` or `lighter`, and `darker` or `blacker`,
or corresponding versions prefixed with `x-`.

### Units and measures

Many micro-class frameworks suffer from a proliferation of classes such as `width-75`.
This limits the user to only the classes the designer provides.
In contrast, we provide individual micro-attributes for numbers, lengths, and units,
so we can write

```
<div 50% width>
<div two rem border>
<div three columns>
```

THe special keyword `size` indicates a ratio to a current size of 100%.
For instance, the following might specify a `flex-basis` of one-third the screen width:

```
<div flex>
  <div basis one third size>
```

All standard CSS units are provided as micro-attributes.
including lengths such as `px`, `em`, and `rem`.
Common numbers and percentages may also be used as micro-attributes,
in addition to built-in classes such as `1/2`.

There are two CSS variables: `--number` and `--length` which are exposed,
for your use in your own CSS micro-attribute or micro-class rules.

We allow numbers to be specified using English words such as "two",
or Arabic numerals such as "2",
and percents as in "ten percent" or "half width",
and fractions such as "1/2".
and lengths as in "five rem".

### Text

The text micro-attribute grouping provides control over text color, fonts, alignment, and so on.
It is introduced by the micro-attribute `text`.
`text` is combined with micro-attributes for color,
font size using standard synonyms such as `large` (or any length),
font weight using standard synonyms such as `bold`, and others.

Other text features include `italic`, `underline`, `upper`, `lower`, `capitalize`, `small-caps`, and so on.

### Borders, margins, outlines, and padding

Borders, margins, outlines, and padding are introduced by the `border`, `margin`, `outline`, and `padding` micro-attributes.
The attributes `top`, `left`, `bottom`, and `right` may be given to indicate which side or sides are to be affected.
A number or length, or keyword such as `thick` or `thin`,  specifies the size of the border, margin, outline, or padding.
For borders and outlines, the standard types such as `solid` and `dotted` are available as micro-attributes.
Colors may also be specified for borders and padding.

### Background

The `background` micro-atteribute provides a background of the specified color.

```
<div beige background>
```

### Sizes

Box sizes are indicated with micro-attributes such as `width` and `height`,
which are given together with other micro-attributes indicating the size,
as a length, percentage, or keyword such as `half`.

```
<div half width>
<div 40% height>
<div max-height 50 vh>
```

### Spacing

People commonly use top margins and bottom margins and top padding and bottom padding and special spacing elements
to space out their elements.
Human CSS classes provide a simple mechanisms for controlling spacing.
The `spaced` micro-attribute adds space between child elements.
Variants of these (indicated by modifier micro-attributes) provide more or less spacing.

Example of spaced children:

```
<div spaced>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
</div>
```

### flexbox

Human CSS expects most layout to be done using flexbox,
and provides a solid set of micro-attributes to control them.
The micro-attributes available include ones to control direction, wrapping, and alignment.
You'll no longer need to struggle with trying to remember the names or meanings or values of
properties like `align-items`.

Examples of flexbox:

```
<div flex wrap>
  <div basis one-third>
  <div basis one-third>
  <div basis one-third>

<div flex vertical justify align-center>
```

### Display and visibility

```
<div show>
<div inline>
<div hide>
<div visible>
<div invisible>
```

### Opacity

```
<div opaque>
<div semi-opaque>
<div transparent>
<div opacity 0.8>
```

### Z-index

```
<div back>
<div front>
<div backmost>
<div frontmost>
```

### Position

```
<div absolute>
<div relative>
<div fixed>
```

### Transitions

```
<div transition fast linear delay>
```

### Things not supported

The following CSS features require more complex properties which are not well-suited to the micro-class approach,
and therefore are not (currently) supported:

1. Animations or more complex transitions
2. Box shadows and text shadows
3. Properties involving URLs, such as `background-image`
4. Pseudo-classes
5. Pseudo-elements

Installation
------------

    npm install --save-dev @rtm/human-css-classes

Then, in some file that the suitCSS compilation will process:

    @import "@rtm/human-css-classes";

To use the pre-built version, use `dist/index.css` or `dist/index.min.css`.
Notice, however, that this will not handle any variables you define yourself.

Note that postCSS always uses the most recently defined variable value.
Therefore, if you include your own variable definitions after importing human CSS classes, they will not take effect.

## Other notes

### Defining your own attributes

What if I want to **include** the `padding` functionality into my own attribute definition?
We would caution against this approach,
which goes against the grain of the micro-class/micro-attribute  philosophy.
However, it does have the "advantage" of allowing me to simply say `<div class="my-class">`.
You can do this using the `postcss-inherit` plug-in, which provides an `@inherit` pseudo-property, as follows:

```
[my-padded-red] {
  @inherit [red], [thick][padding];
}
```

If you really want to go this route, you'll have to make sure to add `postcss-inherit` to your package,
and arrange for it to be added to the list of plug-ins used in the preprocessing step,

### Performance

CSS is rarely the major bottleneck in application performance.
Of course there may be exceptions involving huge systems,
or poorly written CSS rules,
or use of CSS properites with known performance implications.

Human CSS classes offer improved performance because the dozens or hundreds of CSS files often seen in
poorly-engineered applications are much smaller (or not needed at all).
This reduces both download and processing time.

### Floats

We do not use or support floats, and neither should you.

### `!important`

We neither need nor use `!important`, and we recommend you do not either.

### Inline styles

Some element-specific styling can obviously not be handled with micro-attributes,
`background-image` for example.
If a page has only one or two such cases, we suggest inlining the rule with the `style` attribute.
We are not religious zealots, and this can be a better approach than creating a separate CSS file
and defining an additional class merely in order to target the element.
